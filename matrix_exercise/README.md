# Matrix manipulation and filtering with NumPy

This repository contains a simple exercise using NumPy to practice matrix creation, conditional filtering, and file saving.

## Task Description

1. Create a NumPy array of shape **(8, 5)** filled with **random integers between 10 and 99**.
2. Replace all **odd numbers** in the array with `-1`.
3. Create a second array by selecting only the rows where the **sum of the row is greater than 300**.
4. Save both arrays as separate `.csv` files:
   - `matrix_with_negatives.csv`
   - `matrix_sum_filtered.csv`

## Files Included

- `matrix_manipulation_with_Numpy.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with code and explanations.
- `matrix_with_negatives.csv` → Array with `-1` replacing odd values.
- `matrix_sum_filtered.csv` → Array filtered by row sum > 300.

## Skills 

- NumPy array generation and shape handling
- Conditional replacement and boolean filtering
- Row-based filtering using `np.sum()`
- Saving arrays as `.csv` files
- Structuring and documenting code in Jupyter Notebooks
