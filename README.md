## About

I'm Carlos, currently learning Python and data-related tools.  
This repository collects my hands-on practice using NumPy for data manipulation and array operations.

## Matrix Manipulation with NumPy

This repository contains small practice exercises using NumPy to perform common matrix operations such as filtering, aggregation, and saving to file.

## Exercises

- [01 – Matrix Filtering and Row Sum](./01_matrix_exercise/README.md)  
  *Replace odd numbers with -1 and filter rows by total value*

- [02 – Row Mean Calculation](./02_row_mean_exercise/README.md)  
  *Replace values divisible by 3 and append row-wise means*

##  Topics Practiced

- Conditional replacement in NumPy arrays
- Row-wise operations (`np.sum()`, `np.mean()`)
- Array reshaping and stacking
- Saving arrays to CSV files with `np.savetxt()`
- Jupyter Notebook structure and documentation
